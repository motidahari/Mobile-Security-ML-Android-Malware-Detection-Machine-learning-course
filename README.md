In this study, we propose a machine learning-based approach for Android malware detection. By training a model on a dataset of 1817 Android applications, of which 165 were labeled as malicious and 1652 were labeled as benign, the model can learn to distinguish between malicious and benign apps.

We extract features from the apps and use them to train several different models, including a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, Logistic Regression and Linear Support Vector Classifier.

Our experimental results show that the proposed approach using these various models outperform traditional methods in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. For example, one model achieved an accuracy of 0.780, a precision of 0.992, and a recall of 0.762. However, some models such as SVM faced convergence issue, which is a common issue with SVMs, and we received a convergence warning.

This study demonstrates that machine learning can be a more secure method of detecting malware and highlights the potential of this approach for the field of mobile security. The proposed approach can be applied to other malware detection tasks, and further research can be done to improve the performance and security of the model.
